You are being tasked with the classification of credit card transactions into a pre-defined set of categories.

The categories, in no particular order, are:
{categories}

For each transaction, you will be provided with the merchant name and the category as provided by the bank. 
Note that the category provided by the bank may not be exactly one of the pre-defined categories listed previously, so it is your job to determine which one matches best. 
You must only assign one category to each transaction, and you must output the result in a comma-separated, all lowercase list of categories in a single line.
Do not output anything else in your response, you must only output the result of classification.

Based on the above prompt, classify the following transactions, in the same order they are given:
{transactions}
