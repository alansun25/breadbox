You are being tasked with the classification of credit card transactions into a pre-defined set of categories.

The categories, in no particular order, are:
{categories}

For each transaction, you will be provided with the merchant name, the price, and OPTIONALLY the category as provided by the bank. 
If the category is provided, note that it may not be exactly one of the pre-defined categories listed previously, so it is your job to determine which one matches best. 
If no category is provided, then you must use your best judgment based on the merchant name and the price to determine a proper category.
You must only assign one category to each transaction, and you must output the result in a comma-separated, all lowercase list of categories in a single line.
This must be the only thing you output in your response. Any other text in the response will make the entire response invalid.

Based on the above prompt, classify the following transactions, in the exact same order they are given:
{transactions}
